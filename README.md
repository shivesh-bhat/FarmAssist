# FarmAssist: Plant disease detector
### FarmAssist is a web application which uses machine learning and image processing techniques to classify plant leaves into various categories.
### We have used a CNN model for classification and used Jupyter Notebook to build it and train it for 10 epochs. We achieved testing accuracy of 93% and trainig loss of 19%
### Currently FarmAssist can classify the image into thirty eight categories, some of them are:
1. Maize Blight
2. Maize Grey leaf spot
3. Maize Rust
4. Maize Healthy
5. Potato Early Blight
6. Potato Late Blight
7. Potato Healthy

### Along with the classification the model also outputs the confidence of the prediction which can be varying for every image

### We have used the Python Streamlit library to desgin and implement the UI

### Snapshots of UI:
